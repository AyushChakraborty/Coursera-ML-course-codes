# Coursera-ML-course-codes
A bunch of ipynb files that contain the notes and codes written by me while I took the coursera machine learning specialisation course

The files are named as <L_course number_file number>.ipynb where L stands for Lab

A huge thanks to Mr. Andrew Ng and the coursera team for creating this specialisation!!

Additionally other data files and image files are also present which were also a part of the course and they are needed in some of the programs
